## 📘 Summary

This self-published research paper explores the mathematical foundations behind modern artificial intelligence and machine learning systems. It provides a comprehensive overview of how disciplines such as:

- **Linear Algebra** – Matrix operations, vector spaces  
- **Calculus** – Gradients, backpropagation, optimization  
- **Probability & Statistics** – Uncertainty modeling, cross-entropy, KL divergence  
- **Discrete Mathematics** – Graph theory, combinatorics  
- **Optimization** – Convex minimization, Lagrangian methods

...form the core of how AI models learn and make decisions.
